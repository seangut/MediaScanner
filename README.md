# MediaScanner
a simple Windows Application to Scan for Media Files

You cna specify for which extensions to scan and choose the drives to scan.

If you click an entry once it will show a preview, if it is a video you cna click the preview to start the video and click again to pause it.

A double click on the entry will bring you to the corresponding folder. Highlight a file and you can delete it.

That is all it does for now.
